## TP 3 - Vue pratical activity part

# Question 1

When we instal the package locally we can use only in directory related with the current directory, globally we can use the cli wherever you want on your computer.

# Question 2

Because vue work with many components and for sure there are many files for each component.

# Question 3

Babel is use for make your project compatible with many browsers 

# Question 4 

Eslint is a package for force your code to be in the good syntax of javascript version.

# Question 5 

Scoped css is applied only on the same component, however non scoped css is applied on all components of the project with the same class name.

# Question 6

Non-prop attributes passed to a component, if it has a single root element, will automatically be added to that root component.

# Question 7

When a click event is triggered on the button, it will call the handleClick fucntion. This function will create and start a new promise, and is responsible of the title of the button. With the promise, we use finally(), instead of then(), because finally() is triggered for any promise result : fail or success. 

# Question 8

If inheritAttrs is missing or set to true, non-props bindings will be attributed to the root element of the child component in the case of a unique root component. And that's because parent scope attributes will "fail", if not recognized as props.
